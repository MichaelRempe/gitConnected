# gitConnected
MERN Stack Networking application for developers to "git" connected

---

# General Info
gitConnected streamlines the search for programming jobs and people to do them. Our app puts development work at the hands of developers looking for work and allows employers to post information about jobs they have available as well as browse the profiles of programmers.

---

# Instructions
When a user loads the app they have the option to either sign-in or create an account. Once logged in the user creates a profile as either a developer or an employer. Each user is taken to a feed page that either shows a developer available jobs, or shows an employer available developers. When the user makes a selection they are shown additional details about either the job or the developer.
